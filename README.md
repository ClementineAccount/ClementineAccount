### Who am I? ðŸ¤”

- Regarding my interests are in tech, [my main curiosities are in computer graphics, game development and front-end web development](https://clementineaccount.github.io/about/). In particular, I have a fondness for coding stuff that have real-time interactivity and visual components. Despite that, I am open minded to specializing in something different as my career matures.
- My blog, which has more details about [my projects](https://clementineaccount.github.io/categories/projects/) and write some articles, is updated weekly at [https://clementineaccount.github.io/](https://clementineaccount.github.io/)
