### Who am I? ðŸ¤”

- I am a  ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singaporean  ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ computer science undergradute at [Singapore Institute of Technology](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/about/overseas-university-partners/digipen-institute-technology-singapore), where I'd [do a full-time internship program in late 2024](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/integrated-work-study-programme) until graduating finally in May 2025.
- Regarding my interests are in tech, [my main curiosities are in computer graphics, game development and front-end web development](https://clementineaccount.github.io/about/). In particular, I have a fondness for coding stuff that have real-time interactivity and visual components. Despite that, I am open minded to specializing in something different as my career matures.
- My blog, which has more details about [my projects](https://clementineaccount.github.io/categories/projects/) and write some articles, is updated weekly at [https://clementineaccount.github.io/](https://clementineaccount.github.io/)

### Current Lifelong Codebases

[Albuquerque](https://github.com/ClementineAccount/Albuquerque) ðŸŒµ

Albuquerque is my personal hobbyist C++ rendering codebase, which I use to develop different projects such as [Plane Game](https://github.com/ClementineAccount/Albuquerque#plane-game-completed-for-now) and currently a [Voxel Game](https://github.com/ClementineAccount/Albuquerque#voxel-project-currently-working-on) I am a believer in the importance of code reuse and the principles of [Make Games, Not Engines](https://geometrian.com/programming/tutorials/write-games-not-engines/) and so I like to prototype different ideas and projects in the same codebase so that they'd naturally grow into a rendering engine (or even a collection of engines, perhaps?). 

The Albuquerque project's scope is not limited to only 3D graphics using hardware acceleration, as it also explores software renderering through SDL2 or [blitting to an OpenGL texture](https://github.com/ClementineAccount/Milwaukee). I have committed to working on Albuquerque and growing it for the rest of my life, as an invaluable source of learning and creative expression.
